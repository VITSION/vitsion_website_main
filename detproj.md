# Project Report: VITSION Website

## 1. Executive Summary
The VITSION website is a high-performance, visually immersive web application designed for the VITSION Movie Makers Club at VIT Chennai. It serves as a central hub for showcasing films, announcing events (like 'Globus'), introducing the team, and recruiting new members.

## 2. Technical Architecture
### Frontend
- **Framework**: React (Vite) for fast development and optimized builds.
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for utility-first styling, complemented by custom CSS for complex visual effects (glassmorphism, neon glows).
- **Animations**:
    - **GSAP (GreenSock)**: Used for complex timeline-based animations (scroll triggers).
    - **Framer Motion**: Used for component-level transitions and enter/exit animations.
    - **Lenis**: Implemented for premium smooth scrolling logic.
    - **Three.js / OGL**: Used for high-end background effects (Galaxy, Star fields).

### Backend (Server)
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.
- **Current Storage**: File-based (JSON) storage for rapid prototyping.
    - `src/data/home.json`
    - `src/data/films.json`
    - `src/data/events.json`
    - `server/contacts.json`
- **API**: RESTful endpoints creating a bridge between the frontend and the JSON data stores.

## 3. Key Features
- **Immersive Home Page**: Features a 3D galaxy background, video overlays, and scroll-triggered reveals using GSAP.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A secure (client-side) dashboard allowing authorized users to:
    - Add/Edit/Delete Films and Events.
    - Upload posters and images (with crop functionality).
    - View and manage contact form submissions.
    - Update the "Upcoming Event" spotlight on the homepage.
- **Film Showcase**: A dynamic "Films" page displaying "Now Showing" and "Upcoming" releases with poster art.
- **Event Management**: Detailed event pages with galleries and descriptions.
- **Easter Eggs**: Hidden "Core" team page accessible via specific interactions.
- **Performance**:
    - Lazy loading of non-critical routes.
    - Optimization of large assets (recent conversion of 7MB images to WebP).
    - Unified WebGL context (Single Galaxy instance) to reduce GPU load.

## 4. Current Development Status
- **Local Environment**: Fully functional. Admin panel writes to local JSON files.
- **Deployment Status**: 
    - The frontend is production-ready.
    - The backend requires migration to cloud-native persistence (Database & Object Storage) to function correctly on platforms like Render or Vercel.

## 5. Critical Issues & Roadmap
1.  **Data Persistence**:  
    *Issue*: On cloud hosting (Render/Vercel), local files are ephemeral and wipe upon restart.  
    *Solution*: Migrate to **MongoDB** for data and **Cloudinary** for image storage.
2.  **Performance**:  
    *Status*: Significantly improved by resizing assets (`film2.png` -> `film1.webp`) and optimizing the Galaxy background render loop.
